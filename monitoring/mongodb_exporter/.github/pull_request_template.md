Below we provide a basic checklist of things that would make it a good PR:
- Make sure to sign the CLA (Contributor License Agreement).
- Make sure all tests pass.
- Keep current with the target branch and fix conflicts if necessary.
- Update jira ticket description if necessary.
- Attach screenshots and/or console output to the jira ticket to confirm new behavior, if applicable.
- Leave notes to the reviewers if you need to focus their attention on something specific.

Once all checks pass and the code is ready for review, please add `pmm-review-exporters` team as the reviewer. That would assign people from the review team automatically. Report any issues on our [Forum](https://forums.percona.com).
